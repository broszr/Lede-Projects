# Lede-Projects

This is the README, which youâ€™ll find in all sorts of repositories. README will often cover why a repo was created, what it contains, and how to use the content inside.

Since no one wants to read your code, they want to read about your code, and keeping that in mind a solid README if the ticket to success.
