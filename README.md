## Project 2
#### Title:
How Have Jets Changed?
#### Goal Description:
I wanted to analyze the specifications of commercial jetliners from 1952 to the present day to attempt to identify design trends. 
#### Findings:
I found that while jets have changed in a number of ways since the start of the Jet Age, these changes are most apparent and widespread when it comes to fuel efficiency. For most other factors — wingspan, length, power, speed — design trends were more varied and depended on the role of the jet within a commercial fleet.
#### Data collection summary:
For each entry on Wikipedia's [list of purpose built commercial jet airliners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_jet_airliners), I collected a jet's: *Country of origin, *year of airline service entry, *range (km), *wingspan (m),	*height (m),	*length (m),	*empty weight (kg),	*cruising speed (km/h),	*max take off weight (kg),	*max passengers,	*maximum fuel (l),	and *base price ($Million).<br/><br/>
Where possible, I sourced the data from each jet's Wikipedia entry, but when a specific data point was not available there, I consulted several other airplane databases such as [Aerocorner.com](https://aerocorner.com/). For data about a jet's base cost I used [Aerocorner.com](https://aerocorner.com/), while for the yearly average cost of a plane ticket and inflation adjustments I used data from [USInflationCalculator.com](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/airfare-inflation/) and the CPI calculator from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics.](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)
#### Data used for analysis:
All my data can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MlAUMLf1cMMMhZtKqxqs9LO-RRNZkLjxi4mG1rSFUuI/edit?usp=sharing)
#### Overview of the data analysis process:
After I collected my base data, I calculated new variables to compare each jet accurately. These were the *difference between a jet's empty weight and maximum take off weight, *liter/km,	*liter/100km/seat,	*the number of flights needed to recoup base costs at the average cost of a flight ticket,	and *cost per Km per passenger. For variables that involved a monetary figure, I made sure to adjust them to 2025 dollars. <br/><br/>
I then grouped each jet into one of three categories based on the maximum number of passengers it could hold. These were planes with more than 300 seats, planes with between 100 and 299 seats, and planes with fewer than 100 seats. The idea behind this was to use the number of seats as a proxy for whether a plane was intended for long-hauls, medium-hauls, or regional flights. <br/><br/> 
Where I was comparing only one variable or looking at industry trends as a whole, I created DataWrapper charts. Where I compared two or more variables or when I broke down a variable by the type of jet, I created scatterplot charts (and one combination line/bar chart) in Google Sheets.  
#### A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project
This was my first time using DataWrapper, which proved to be a steeper learning curve than I expected. I now feel more confident in my ability to make complex DataWrapper charts. In addition to that, I flexed and built new skills in Adobe Illustrator (where I designed models of various jets using schematics I found online), CSS, and HTML. Specifically in CSS, I learned how to make a small animation and how to format different types of content into grids. 
#### A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)
I would have liked to done more statistical analysis of the data I collected and see if the trends I identified were actually statistically significant. I would have also liked to dive deeper into the factors behind the trends I identified, such as what seems to be pushing aerospace companies to invest in higher fuel efficiency vs increasing passenger capacity.
